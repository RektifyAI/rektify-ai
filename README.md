# Rektify AI
Dynamic code analysis tool powered by machine learning to enable optimal security smart contracts. As the blockchcain space grows, so does the amount of rich data-points generated from technical attacks. The more data that is collected on isolated attack instances on protocols, the more likely we can train models to defend against attacks in an adversarial attack frameowork.

Languages: 
- Solidity (EVM-bytecode)
- Go
- Rust
- Clarity (smart contracts on Bitcoin)
- sCrypto (smart contracts on Bitcoin SV)
